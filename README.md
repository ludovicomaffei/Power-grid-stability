# Power-grid-stability

In recent years, Smart Grid technology has gained increasing importance in the energy industry, thanks to its ability to ensure an efficient, sustainable system with low losses and high levels of security and reliability. A Smart Grid is an electrical network that efficiently integrates the behavior and actions of all connected users - generators, consumers, and those who perform both roles - in order to ensure an economically efficient, sustainable energy system with low losses and high levels of security and reliability.

An important aspect of Smart Grids is distributed generation. This involves the integration of local energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable sources directly into the grid. This reduces dependence on traditional power plants and promotes the production of clean and sustainable energy. However, to convince more users to participate in a Smart Grid, it is necessary to ensure the stability of the grid. Stability refers to the network's ability to maintain a reliable and balanced distribution of electrical energy. The network must be able to predict faults so that they can be avoided or their damage limited, and to provide an amount of energy equal to the demand. To achieve this, data monitoring and analysis are essential.

This thesis focuses on the use of machine learning techniques to predict the stability of the Smart Grid. In particular, the goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that the use of properly trained deep neural networks allows for highly accurate prediction of Smart Grid stability.
